# Fails when the user-facing docs disagree with the code or with each other:
#   1. CHANGELOG.md opens with the changelogTitle that semantic-release keeps;
#   2. the README has its fixed shape, its Install section matches
#      .goreleaser.yaml, its command block matches the cobra tree, its targets
#      table matches the config's target types and its links resolve;
#   3. CONTRIBUTING's repository layout names every module of go.work;
#   4. the CLI reference on the docs site names every command and flag the
#      cobra tree has (and no command that does not exist), the site's sidebar
#      matches its pages, and the agent skill names every command;
#   5. the same guarded words as check_readme_claims.sh are applied to the
#      skill and the docs pages.
# Checks 2 to 4 are Go tests, so they read the real command tree.
